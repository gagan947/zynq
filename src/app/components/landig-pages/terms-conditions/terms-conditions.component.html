      <h1 class="mb-4 text-center ct_fs_28 ct_fw_600">Terms & Conditions</h1>

      <p>These terms (“Terms”) govern your use of the Zynq Nordic AB app, website, and related services (“Services”).
            By using the Services, you accept these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the
            Services.</p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years old (or have a parent’s consent) to use Zynq. By creating an account or using the
            Services, you confirm that you meet this requirement.</p>

      <h2>2. Account and Registration</h2>
      <p>Some features require an account. You agree to:</p>
      <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate and up-to-date information,</li>
            <li>Keep your login credentials secure,</li>
            <li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You are responsible for all activities under your account. Do not share or transfer your account.</p>

      <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>When using Zynq, you must not:</p>
      <ul>
            <li>Upload or distribute illegal, offensive, infringing, or harmful content,</li>
            <li>Impersonate others or violate their rights,</li>
            <li>Attempt to hack, manipulate, or disrupt the Services.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or delete content and terminate accounts that violate these rules.</p>

      <h2>4. User Content and Personal Data</h2>
      <p>You retain ownership of any content you upload (“User Content”). By uploading content, you grant us a
            non-exclusive license to store and display it to provide the service.</p>
      <ul>
            <li>Zynq processes sensitive personal data (health and skin data). Such data is explicitly protected under
                  GDPR so your explicit consent is required.</li>
            <li>Zynq Nordic AB is the data controller for information processed in the app; each clinic/provider is the
                  controller for personal data collected during medical care or product sales.</li>
            <li>All processing complies with the GDPR.</li>
            <li>You have rights under GDPR: you may request a copy of your data, correct inaccuracies, and request
                  deletion of your account/data (unless law requires retention). Upon deletion, your data will be
                  anonymized or removed per our Privacy Policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>All trademarks, logos, designs, text, graphics, and software in Zynq belong to Zynq Nordic AB or its licensors.
            You may not copy, modify, distribute, or otherwise use our materials without our written permission.</p>

      <h2>6. Payments, Purchases, and Withdrawal Rights</h2>
      <p>Purchases made via Zynq are processed through Swish, Klarna or Stripe. All prices are SEK including VAT. You
            are responsible for providing correct payment details.</p>
      <ul>
            <li>For each purchase, you will receive an order confirmation. You must cancel or reschedule bookings in
                  accordance with the provider’s policies. Cancellation and refund terms are provided at the time of
                  purchase (set by the clinic or vendor). Zynq Nordic AB is not responsible for those terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Right of Withdrawal:</strong> By law, you have a 14-day right to withdraw from distance
                  purchases. For services, the 14-day period starts the day after you enter into the agreement. If you
                  consent to immediate start of a service, the withdrawal right is forfeited for any part of the service
                  already performed.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions: Any subscription renewals occur only if clearly disclosed at purchase and you have given
                  your consent.</li>
            <li>Zynq Nordic AB acts only as a payment intermediary. Products or services are delivered by the
                  clinic/provider. Zynq is not legally the seller or payment recipient.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Zynq as a Facilitator</h2>
      <p>Zynq Nordic AB provides a digital platform for skin analysis, booking, payment, and communication.</p>
      <ul>
            <li>Zynq is not a party to the contract between you and any clinic or reseller you book or purchase from via
                  the app. The actual agreement is between you and the clinic/provider.</li>
            <li>Each provider is solely responsible for medical advice, treatment quality, patient safety, and legality
                  of products. Zynq has no responsibility for medical outcomes or product quality.</li>
            <li>Any disputes related to treatments, care, or products must be resolved directly with the provider.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Provider Verification</h2>
      <p>Zynq conducts reasonable checks when clinics/providers register (e.g. verification of licenses and organization
            details). These checks do not guarantee that providers maintain valid licenses or insurance. It is the
            provider’s responsibility to keep all credentials and information up to date.</p>

      <h2>9. Account Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms. You may also close your account at any
            time via the app or by contacting support. Upon termination, your personal data will be deleted or
            anonymized according to our Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>10. Limitation of Liability and Medical Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Zynq is provided “as is”. We make no warranties that the app’s analysis, recommendations, or product
            information are error-free or up-to-date. The skin analysis and AI-based features are for decision support
            only and must not replace professional medical advice. The app is not a diagnostic tool. In case of health
            concerns, always consult a licensed healthcare professional. Zynq is not liable for indirect damages, lost
            profits, or unmet expectations to the extent permitted by law.</p>

      <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Zynq Nordic AB and its employees harmless from any claims, costs, or damages
            arising from your breach of these Terms or misuse of the Services.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>Zynq Nordic AB may update these Terms. We will notify you of significant changes via the app or email. Your
            continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

      <h2>13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by Swedish law. Any dispute should first be raised with our support. If unresolved,
            disputes will be settled in Swedish courts, with Stockholm District Court as the first instance.</p>

            are responsible for keeping your device and login information secure.</p>

      <h2>16. Availability</h2>

            responsible for the app’s content or support.</p>

      <h2>18. Force Majeure</h2>
      <p>Zynq Nordic AB is not liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond our control (e.g. natural
            disasters, war, government actions, strikes, or third-party failures).</p>

            information, contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@getzynq.io">support&#64;getzynq.io</a>. This
            helps us improve the service.</p>

      <h2>21. Severability</h2>

            full force.</p>

      <h2>22. Language</h2>
      <p>These Terms are written in Swedish. An English translation is provided for convenience; in case of any
            conflict, the Swedish version prevails.</p>
